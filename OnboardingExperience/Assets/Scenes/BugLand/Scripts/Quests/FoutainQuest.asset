  title: Trouble At The Foutain
  details: Hello there! I'm trying to get water out of the local foutain but something's
    wrong! Everytime I use the foutain, the world around me starts to freeze and
    act up! Could you please check it out for me? The foutain is to the left, you
    can walk up to it and press E to activate the foutain. Maybe you could use some
    sort of profiler tool to diagnose the issue?
  helpTip: "The foutain is creating way too many gameobjects! This is causing a heavy
    load on the CPU. You have to be careful about how many active objects are being
    created at the same time and be mindful in order to reduce load on your system.
    A method to reduce the performance cost of spawning so many gameobjects is object
    pooling. In an object pool you don't need to constatly create brand new objects
    and you just re-use objects that are already in the starting pool. Object Pooling
    is a  design pattern that pre-instantiates all the objects you\u2019ll need at
    any specific moment before gameplay. Suggest using an object pool to your team
    if a similar issue arises in your project."
