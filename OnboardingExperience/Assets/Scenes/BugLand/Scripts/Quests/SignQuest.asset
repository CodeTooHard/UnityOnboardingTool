  title: My Sign!!!
  details: Oh no! Something terrible has happened to my new sign! None of the text
    fits right like it's supposed to. All that has changed is my screen got a little
    bigger. Can you please take a look at the sign over there?
  helpTip: When changing the screen size of a solution, the UI can break and become
    off-scale from where it used to be. This is typically because the canvas of the
    affected UI either is missing the Canvas Scaler component or that the Canvas
    scaler is incorrectly set up. You can add a canvas scaler component to the SignUI
    gameobject, select "scale with screen size" and then play with the x and y values
    until the scaling looks correct to resolve this issue.
