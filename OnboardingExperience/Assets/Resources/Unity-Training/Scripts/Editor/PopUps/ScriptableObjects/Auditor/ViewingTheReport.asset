  title: What does it mean?
  mainText: "Once you have completed an auditor scan. You need to navigate to the
    \"Code Issues\" section but clicking on the blue text next to \"Code Issues\".
    This will take you to all of the audits for the code of your project.\n\nFrom
    here we need to modify a couple settings. Under \"Filters\" we have some options.
    \"Assembly\" controls which code the project is auditing. For this we want to
    disable all code except the \"Assembly-CSharp\" assembly. This ensures we are
    only testing our internal code. \n\n\"Area\" controls which types of issues are
    being monitored. Typically we always monitor all areas but if you need a specific
    area like for CPU testing, you can limit the warnings to just CPU areas.\n\nThe
    only other setting we typically change is the \"Show\" setting. We want to checkmark
    the critical issues component. Non-critical issues are typically not high enough
    priority to warrant development time so unless we are ahead of schedule we want
    to just focus on critical issues."
