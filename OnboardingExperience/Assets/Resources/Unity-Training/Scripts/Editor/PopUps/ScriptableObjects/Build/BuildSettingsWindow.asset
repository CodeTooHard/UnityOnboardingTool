  title: Build Settings Overview
  mainText: "This is the Build Settings window. At the top of this window is the
    Scenes In Build section. This shows you all of the scenes that will be included
    in your build. If you don't add your scene, it won't be loaded into the executable
    file and won't play. \n\n- Click the \"Add Open Scenes\" button to add all the
    scenes in your project to the builder.\n\nOnce you add a secene to your build,
    you can use the checkbox to the left of their title to individually select and
    deselect scenes to build. This can be really useful when you want to reduce build
    time because you only need to test something in a single scene. \n\nUnder this
    section are the platform details. To the left, we have the platform to select.
    For most cases you will be working with the Windows, Mac, Linux option. To the
    right, we have additional settings. Some important settings to note are:\n\n-
    Create Visual Studio Solution: This will generate visual studio files so you
    can launch the build from visual studio. This can be useful when working with
    tools that require visual studio's .sln file like Sonarqube.\n\n-Development
    Build: This will mark your build for development and give you access to additional
    build options for debugging.\n\n- Autoconnect Profiler: This setting will attempt
    to automatically link the profiler in your editor to the open application so
    you can do performance testing on the production level build.\n\n-Script Debugging:
    This will allow you to see console log, warning and error messages while still
    in the build instead of having to exit and view text files in the build folder.
    This is useful for doing live troubleshooting and further testing defects."
