  title: Time to Deliver!
  mainText: Exporting is made really easy in Auditor. This tool allows us to export
    all the data we see into a .CSV file that we can edit and deliver. To export
    the data to a CSV there is a "Export" button to the right of the Auditor window
    next to the black "Details" window. The export button allows you to export issues
    you are currently clicked on or export all the issues currently showing. Go ahead
    and export all the folders and drag the .csv file into the "Test Artifact" folder.
