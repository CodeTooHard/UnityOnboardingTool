  title: Running Your Build
  mainText: 'To complete the build process, you can either click "Build" or "Build
    and Run" to the left of this window. Build will allow you to select where you
    want to build your project, and build and run does the same but will also automatically
    launch your solution for you. Otherwise, you will have to navigate to the folder
    you chose to build in and manually launch the .exe file.


    Reminder: It is
    good practice to create and name a folder "Builds" to store builds in for your
    project.'
