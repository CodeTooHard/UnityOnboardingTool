  title: Gameobject Created!!!
  mainText: "Congratulations!! You have created your first game object! You can think
    of an empty game object like a bucket for data. We can add data through components
    (which we will talk about later) to turn the game object into many different
    things. We can add models, scripts, lights, and animations to these game objects
    to turn them into anything but first, they start as empty buckets of data like
    we just created.\n\nWhy don't we give it a name? \n\nTo name a gameobject, right
    click it and select 'rename' or left click it and press the f2 button on your
    keyboard."
